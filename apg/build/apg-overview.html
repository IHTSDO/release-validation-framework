Java APG is APG, an <b><u>A</u></b>BNF <b><u>P</u></b>arser <b><u>G</u></b>enerator,
written in the Java language. 
</p>
<p>
The "apg" package contains the parser generator and the runtime library of functions required
by all parsers that it generates.
</p>
<p>The "examples" package contains a driver function to run any and all of the included tests.
The tests themselves are in the examples sub-packages.<br>
These examples demonstrate a variety of ways to use Java APG and its new UDT feature.
</p>
<p>
A summary of Java APG's new features is:
<ul>
<li>
Both APG and the parsers it generates are written entirely in Java.
</li>
<li>
A new operator, the User-Defined Terminal (UDT), is introduced
which puts semantic actions on a nearly equal footing with the other
ABNF terminal phrases such as the literal string.
UDTs allow the user to write phrase recognition functions, including non-Context-Free phrases, and convert them to
parser operators.
</li>
<li>
The AST is optionally available in XML format, freeing the user to develop a translator with the XML parser of the his/her choice.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
APG was originally written to fulfill a need for a parser generator that would generate parsers
directly from ABNF grammars as defined by the IETF in 
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234" target=_blank&quot;>RFC 5234</a>.
Since then the grammar syntax for APG has evolved from that standard 
1) to generate unambiguous parsers
and 2) to add capabilities beyond the class of context-free-languages.
Because of 2) the APG grammars are called SABNF (Superset ABNF).
ABNF and SABNF will often be used interchangably in this document. 
The differences between RFC 5234 grammars and  SABNF are summarized here:
<ul>

<li>
The &lt;prose-val&gt; element is not supported.
</li>

<li>
APG accepts case-sensitive literal strings enclosed in single quotes.
</li>

<li>
APG accepts the syntactic predicate operators AND(&amp;) and NOT(!).
</li>

<li>
Java APG accepts User-Defined Terminals (UDTs). UDTs appear in rule expressions
just like rule names, accept that the names must begin with <code>u_</code> or
<code>e_</code> (* see below).
The underscore insures that there will never be
a name conflict with a rule name. No rule name definition is given for the UDTs.
</li>

<li>
Prioritized-choice is used to disambiguate the grammars. That is, alternates are tried
as they appear in the grammar from left to right. The first alternate to successfully match a phrase
is accepted and all other alternates are ignored.
</li>

<li>
Repetitions always consume the longest string possible
with no alternative being considered.
</li>

</ul>
<p>
(*) The reason for the two designations <code>u_</code> and
<code>e_</code> is a subtle but serious difference as to whether the UDT will accept empty
strings or not. <code>e_</code> indicates that the UDT <i>will</i> accept empty strings.
<code>u_</code> indicates that the UDT <i>will not</i> accept empty strings. The Parser
enforces this distinction. If a UDT named <code>u_my-udt</code>, for example, returns
an empty string the Parser will throw and exception. The reason for this has to do with the
fact that left-recursive grammars will put the Parser into an infinite loop that will cause a stack-overflow. 
The check for left-recursiveness in the <code>GeneratorAttributes</code> class relies on
knowing whether the rule name operators (and UDT operators as well) accept empty strings.
The general properties of the UDT's are unknown to the Generator because they are user written. This
naming convention and the Parser's enforcing of it is the only way to prevent a possible stack-overflow
due to a hidden left-recursion.<p>
