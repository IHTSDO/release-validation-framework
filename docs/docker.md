Using Docker
===================

These instructions will provide guidance in getting the RVF running on your local machine for development and testing using docker.


Prerequisites
-------------

You will need:
- [Git Client](https://git-scm.com/) to clone the project
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) for docker(!)

Starting the application
------------------------

Clone the project then start using docker-compose:

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/IHTSDO/release-validation-framework.git
> cd release-validation-framework
> docker-compose up -d
```

That's it.
